# Website for a local Supermarket - Supermercado Couto

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary:

This project was developed with ReactJS and designed in Figma, as a way of training and improving my Frontend skills.
I created two fake DB's, one for products and another for product categories, as I didn't have access to the supermarkets official DB at the time of developing.

***

*Feel free to deploy the project using the following workflow:*
```
$ git clone https://github.com/luiscouto99/coutosuper.git
